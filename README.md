# DVLD-Project
DVLD is a .NET Framework application built using ADO.NET and SQL Server.

This repository includes SQL scripts that allow the database to be created
and initialized easily on any environment with SQL Server installed.
## Database Setup
The DatabaseScript folder contains SQL scripts that:
- Create all required database tables
- Insert essential default (seed) data, including:
  - A pre-filled Countries table
  - A default user/person for initial access and testing

After executing the scripts, the database will be fully ready to use.
